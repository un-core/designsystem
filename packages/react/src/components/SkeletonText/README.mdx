**OVERVIEW**

A Skeleton is an animated placeholder that simulates the layout of a page / screen while data is being loaded. It mitigates focus on the loading process and improves the user’s perceived load time.

**HOW IT WORKS**

Skeleton graphic elements appears in place of the content to be loaded and disappear all together when the content is fully loaded.

**RULES**

- A Skeleton should provide a close representation of the ultimate page layout and content once loaded.
- All elements should have same colour and animation.
- Alle elements should have the same size of the represented content.
- Meant to be used specifically on a white background.

**DOS**

- ✓ Use for pages where all content loads at the same time.
- ✓ Loading for dynamic content; use actual content when content doesn’t change (static content).
- ✓ Use motion within the Skeleton to reinforce that the page is loading behind the scenes.
- ✓ Ideal for pages that require longer initial load times.

**DONTS**

- ✗ Never use skeletons to give feedback for in-context actions such as saving a form or fetching search results. Instead use the progress or spinner component.
- ✗ If the visual layout/format of the content being loaded is unknown; or you need to indicate processing or that change will occur on the page (rather than loading UI elements), consider using a loading dots instead.

**ACCESSIBILITY**
A Skeleton should announce to users using a screen reader that content or a page is being loaded.
