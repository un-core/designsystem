WFP is using [Figma](https://figma.com) for all of our design work. It is a powerful tool that allows us to collaborate and share our work with the rest of the team. It also allows us to create a UI Kit that can be used by all designers to create consistent and accessible designs.

All of WFPs design files are stored in the [WFP Design System](https://www.figma.com/@unwfp) team. These files contains all of the components, styles, and icons that are used in our designs. It is the single source of truth for all design work.
