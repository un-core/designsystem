### Usage

They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

- Buttons should always have a label, except when using a universally understood and accessible icon.
- Optional icons should not be used for decoration and should only be included when necessary and strongly associated with the label text.
- The label can be hidden to create an icon-only button, with a tooltip providing the label when necessary.
- TODO: Discuss Use Medium size for default interface, while you can use the small version for mobile or inside other interface elements (such as **Callout**, **Tables**, …)
- Use a button group to show additional actions.
- When the button label is not visible, a tooltip will appear when the user hovers over the button. The tooltip will show the label text and, if applicable, a keyboard shortcut.

## How to use

Button has a range of styles that cater to different needs. They are designed to highlight where users need to take action in order to proceed through a process.

<DoUse>

- Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include `Add`, `Save`, `Delete`, and `Sign up`. Each page can have one or two primary or accent buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary buttons.
- Use icons only when necessary TODO: Discuss, should it be only restricted when only icon without any text
- Be concise and use verbs for the labels

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.
- Never use capitalization to emphasize a specific button. TODO: Discuss there was previously an all caps Button
- Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use Links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page. TODO: Discuss, in the intro it is mentioned

</DoNotUse>

### Accessibility

Press the Space or Enter key to execute the button action. The button will remain in focus, unless it opens or closes a container, in which case the focus will move to the target or back to the caller.

### Actions 🎬

TODO: Currently missing, we need to tell when to use which button

When an action required by the user has more than one option, always use a a negative action button (`secondary`) paired with a positive action button (`primary` in that order.

Negative action buttons will be on the left. Positive action buttons should be on the right.
