### How to use

The default variant of the primary link is indicated by the color blue. It is intended to attract attention to the link and is most suitable when the blue color does not create an overwhelming visual experience.

<DoUse>

- Links are for usage in body copy and are not appropriate in titles. TODO: Discuss if more are fine
- Use text for links rather than graphics or icons.
- Links should be three words or less.
- Text should be consistent with the title of the intended destination.
- Navigate to a different page within the application
- Navigate to an entirely different site
- Jump to an element on the same page
- Link to emails or phone numbers

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Avoid the term “click here“, “other links“ to “here,” or the web address itself. Instead, use a meaningful descriptive label for the link, and match the destination site name.
- Use a button instead of a link for actions that will change data or manipulate how it is displayed, change a state, or trigger an action. Buttons should never be used for navigational actions.

</DoNotUse>

### Accessibility

- Keyboard interaction: Enter
  Executes the link and moves the focus to the link target.
